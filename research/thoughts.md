looking into this more and more I get the strong sense that it is a mistake to need js for AA to run.. just so many headaches with AA -> MediaLibraryService -> JS.. I have been putting more thought in cutting out the js middleman completely.. which also means cutting out all callbacks from native to js when it comes to player interaction..

an alternative for AA is to just have it interact with a json based api -
